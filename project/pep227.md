% PEP: 227 - Statically Nested Scopes
% Louis Bouddhou, Alex Campbell, Josh Fermin

# What is the problem?
  
Nested functions (including lambdas) can reference variables defined in the surrouding namespace

Static scoping is good  

# Example

```python
 def bank_account(initial_balance):
      balance = [initial_balance]
      def deposit(amount):
          balance[0] = balance[0] + amount
          return balance
      def withdraw(amount):
          balance[0] = balance[0] - amount
          return balance
      return deposit, withdraw
``` 

# Introduced changes in this PEP

Gives nested functions the scope of parent functions.

This allows for variables within the parent function to be inherited by the nested function.



# Namespaces

Whenever you run a simple Python script, the interpreter treats it as a module called __main__, which gets its own namespace. Also, the builtin functions that you would use live in another module called __builtin__ and
