1. Grammars: Synthetic Examples

	a.
	```
	Axioms:
	V ::= a | b

	-------------	   -------------
	a ∈ VObjects		b ∈ VObjects


	Rules:
	A ::= V

	t ∈ VObjects	
	------------	   
	t ∈ AObjects



	A ::= A&A

	t ∈ AObjects
	------------
	t&t ∈ AObjects
	
	```

	b.
	```
	given: a & b & b:

	     A            
        /|\           
       A & A          
      /|\   \  
     A & A   V         
     |   |   |       
     V   V   b        
     |   |
     a   b

     	 A            
        /|\           
       A & A  
      /   /|\
     V   A & A
     |   |   |
     a   V   V
     	 |	 |
     	 b   b
 	```

 	This grammar is ambiguous because we can see that for the same solution it produces two different parse trees.

 	c.
 	```
 	S = aA | bB | cC
 	  = aaA | bbB | ccC
 	  = aaaaA | bbb | ccccC
 	```  
 	This prints out either a series of a's or series of c's or series of b's or an empty string.

 	<br>
 	d.

 	baab - This sentence can be generated by this grammar:
 	```
 	S = AaBb
 	S = baBb
 	S = baab
 	```

 	bbbab - This sentence cannot be generated, because we produce an extra 'a':
 	```
 	S = AaBb
 	S = AbaBb
 	S = AbaaBb
 	```

 	bbaaaaa - This sentence cannot be generated, because we end with an 'a' and not a 'b':
 	```
 	S = AaBb
 	```

 	bbaab - This sentence can be generated by this grammar:
 	```
 	S = AaBb
 	S = AbaBb
 	S = Abaab
 	S = bbaab
 	```
 	<br>
 	e.

 	abcd - This sentence can be generated by this grammar:
 	```
 		     S
 		  / | | \
 		 a  S c  B
 		 	|    |
 		 	b    d
 	```
 	acccbd - cannot be generated by this grammar because the rightmost B cannot produce both a 'b' and 'd' terminal symbol.
 	```
 		     S
 		  / | | \
 		 a  S c  B
 		   / \    
 		  c   A   
 		  	  |
 		  	  c
 	```
 	acccbcc - cannot be generated by this grammar because the rightmost B cannot produce a 'b', 'c', and 'c' terminals (i.e. the last 3 letters)
 	```
 		     S
 		  / | | \
 		 a  S c  B
 		   / \    
 		  c   A   
 		  	  |
 		  	  c
 	```
 	acd - cannot be generated by this grammar because there is no way to produce only 3 terminal symbols
	```
		     S
		  / | | \
		 a  S c  B
	 ```
	 accc - This can be produced by this grammar
 	```
		     S
		  / | | \
		 a  S c  B
		    |    |
		    A    A
		    |    |
		    c    c
    ```

2. Grammars: Understanding a Language

	a. 

	i. The first grammar contains two terminals which are operand and operator. It is left associative because it recurses on the left side where the rule is: <i>e operator operand</i>. An example parse tree for the first grammar would be:
	```
	     e            
        /|\           
       e or od          
      /|\   
     e or od        
     |      
    od   
    ```
    Where <i>or</i> is operator and <i>od</i> is operand.


	The second grammar contains three terminal symbols which are operand, operator, and ε. This grammar is right associative because it recurses on esuffix which on the right side e ::= operand esuffix. An example parse tree for this grammar would be as follows:
	```
	 	 e            
        / \           
      od   S 
     	  /|\
        or od S
	         /|\
	       or od S
	        	 |
	        	 ε
	```
	Where <i>or</i> is operator, <i>od</i> is operand and <i>S</i> is essufix.

	ii. These grammars generate the same expression. This is because they both recurse, the first one recurses on itself, while the second one recurses through esuffix. And also, for the first one there is a sequence of operator operand preceded by recursive call e.
	For the second one there is a sequence of the same operator and operand this time followed by the recursive call essufix. Also, if you look at the parse trees above, they return the same terminal symbols, minus the epsilon.

	b.

	The - operator has precedence over << as seen from the following examples from the output of the scala interpreter:
	
	``` scala
		scala> 10 << 2 - 4
		res17: Int = -2147483648
		scala> (10 << 2) - 4
		res0: Int = 36
		scala> 10 << (2 - 4)
		res0: Int = -2147483648

		scala> 10 - 8 << 10
		res20: Int = 2048
		scala> (10 - 8) << 10
		res2: Int = 2048
		scala> 10 - (8 << 10)
		res3: Int = -8182
	```


	c.
	``` scala
	<float> ::= <sign> <digit> <decimal-point> <digit> <exponent>
	<sign> ::= - | ε
	<digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 
	<decimal-point> ::= .
	<exponent> ::= E <sign> <digit> | ε
	```
